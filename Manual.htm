<h3>About Burglars</h3>
<p><img src="Images/Burglar.png" width="374" height="209" alt="Burglar"></p>
<p>Recently the Spiegel published an <b><a href="http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/einbruchdiebstahl-in-deutschland-sechs-mythen-im-check-a-1043821.html" target="_blank">article</a></b> 
  about burglars in Germany:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Burglars prefer the <b>dark months</b>. In december the insurances report 
    3 times more housebreakings than in july.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>The police reports that it is very difficult to find the delinquents. Mostly 
    there are no witnesses and no traces. Only in <b>2,6%</b> of the housebreakings 
    the culprit can be condemned.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Burglars do not only break into houses of rich people. <b>Everybody</b> 
    can be the victim. In nearly every house they find handies, laptops or money 
    in cash. Especially drug addicts chose houses in their near environment.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>According to the experience of the police the best prevention is a <b>mechanical 
    protection</b> at doors and windows and attentive neighbours. Mostly burglars 
    try only 2 - 3 minutes to break into a house. But in 60% of the cases they 
    are successful.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>This <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/einbrueche-mobile-banden-bereiten-ermittlern-sorge-a-1093673.html" target="_blank"><b>article</b></a> 
    tells that the German police observes that more and more housebreakings are 
    organized by professional gangs from Serbia, Romania, Turkey, Albania and 
    Georgia. These people apply for asylum and travel through different countries 
    of Europe to do just one thing: steal.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>There is also another <b><a href="http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/einbrecher-wo-die-meisten-einbrueche-stattfinden-a-1092820.html" target="_blank">article</a></b> 
    with a map of Germany that shows the cities where the majority of housebreakings 
    take place. The police counted 152.000 cases in 2015 - tendency increasing.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>The majority of door locks is highly insecure</h3>

<p>Does your door lock protect you against burglars ?<br>
  If your key looks like this one:<br>
  <img src="Images/Key.png" width="157" height="73"><br>
  it surely does not.<br>
  Your door can be opened within a few seconds and you don't even notice that 
  someone has entered while you were not at home, because there is no damage, 
  neither at the door nor at the lock. Also your neighbours will not hear anything 
  because lockpicking is absolutely silent.<br>
  <br>
  You don't believe that ?<br>
  Then watch this video:<br>
  <br>
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cjuT_63Ioig" target="_blank"><img src="Images/Youtube.jpg" width="560" height="315" alt="Lockpicking"> 
  </a> <br>
  <br>
  As you have seen: Lockpicking is very easy.<br>
  A thief does not even need special tools. He can open your lock with two hairpins!<br>
  When you search for &quot;lockpicking&quot; on Youtube you will find 169.000 
  results.<br>
  <br>
  With electrical vibrators (pick gun) it takes less than 10 seconds to open a 
  lock as you see in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO67Tdy3D0g" target="_blank">this 
  video</a>.</p>
<p>Even for cross locks there are special lockpicking tools that open a lock in 
  10 seconds as you see in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAq5dn38z7M" target="_blank">this 
  video</a>. </p>
<h3>Better mechanical locks</h3>
<p>There are better locks where the key has round holes instead of notches like 
  this KESO 2000 key.<br>
  <img src="Images/Key2.png" width="160" height="77"><br>
  These locks are very expensive. Nevertheless they can also be opened by lockpicking, 
  although it may take 3 minutes to open them as you see in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYuN3EpgIy8" target="_blank">this 
  video</a>.<br>
</p>
<p>Finally locks can be broken with a big plier or opened with a drill as you 
  see in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmRNPmGsIto" target="_blank">this 
  video</a>.</p>
<p><b>Conclusion:</b> You will not find a mechanical lock that is really safe.</p>
<h3>Copying of keys</h3>
<p>If you rent a flat, your tenant can make copies of the key and give them to 
  other persons. So he can sublease your flat. And if he leaves some day and you 
  want to rent the flat anew, you have to change the lock because otherwise the 
  previous tenant can still access the flat.</p>
<h3>Electronic door locks</h3>
<p>The advantage of an electronic door lock is that the above security issues 
  do not apply.<br>
  It is much better to have a safe door lock which prevents that the thief can 
  enter than to have an alarm system which makes noise when the thief is already 
  in. Until the police arrives he will be gone and probably some precious things 
  will be missing. Secure locks are always better than alarm systems or cameras.<br>
  <br>
  What are the options on the market?<br>
  I searched for an electronic alternative, but what I found did not satisfy me:</p>
<ul>
  <li>There are fingerprint readers, but I did not find a waterproof one, so not 
    usefull for outdoor installation. Additionally you expose an electronic device 
    to the street which a malicious person might destroy easily.</li>
  <li>There are these electronic door locks that you probably have seen in hotels, 
    that open the door with a card.<br>
    But these are for indoor installation only and they depend on a tiny battery 
    in the lock that soon will expire.</li>
  <li>None of the electronic solutions that I found will work when you have a 
    power failure because they all lack a powerfull backup battery. A lock that 
    does not open in case of a power failure is useless.</li>
  <li>Mostly the electronic solutions are much too expensive.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Features</h1>
  
<p>So I designed my own solution with the following <b>characteristics</b>: </p>
<ol>
  <li>Designed for the main door of the building: No electronic device is exposed 
    to the street or to the rain. You just mount an RFID reader on the <b>inside 
    of the door</b> which reads the RFID card through the closed door.</li>
  <li>There is nothing visible from the outside of the door that could be manipulated 
    by an intruder. </li>
  <li>A powerfull <b>backup battery</b> assures that the device is working even 
    during a power failure of more than one week.</li>
  <li>The processor checks the battery <b>voltage</b> and alerts if it is out 
    of range.</li>
  <li>The processor checks if the <b>battery is old</b> and alerts when the battery 
    must be replaced.</li>
  <li>Provides a very <b>easy to use interface</b> accessible through an USB cable 
    with a terminal program which lets you add or remove users within a few seconds. 
    Even a computer beginner can manage the user authorization quickly.</li>
  <li>You can store <b>64 users</b> with their cards in the EEPROM of the microprocessor. 
    More then 64 users are possible by modifying the source code.</li>
  <li>The access to the terminal interface can be protected with a <b>password</b>.</li>
  <li>If you or your tenant loses the RFID card, you can easily delete the card 
    from the EEPROM without having to change the mechanical door lock.</li>
  <li>I designed a <b>layout</b> for the board that can be soldered by an electronics 
    beginner.</li>
  <li>The entire solution is <b>cheap</b> compared with commercial solutions.</li>
  <li>Supposed that you have a secure door that cannot be opened with a <b>crowbar</b>, 
    this solution is much cheaper than any <b>insurance</b> that you pay your 
    entire life. I don't pay any insurance anymore.</li>
  <li>The entire project has been designed and tested by a very experienced hardware 
    and software engineer.</li>
</ol>
<h3>RFID cards and tokens</h3>
<p>What will replace your mechanic key?<br>
  You can either chose an RFID card or a token like these:</p>
<p><img src="Images/Mifare.png" width="719" height="176" alt="Mifare RFID cards"></p>
<p>The cards are sensible to bending so you should not carry them in your pocket because they may break.<br>
  Other names for tokens are &quot;tag&quot; and &quot;keyfob&quot;.</p>
<p>Each RFID card or token has a <b>unique ID number</b>, which is assigned by 
  the factory and which cannot be modified afterwards. There are cards (like Mifare 
  Classic) that have a 4 byte ID which allows 2^32 possible ID's and other cards 
  (like MIFARE Desfire) that use a 7 byte ID which allows 2^56 possible 
  ID's: Far more than any mechanic key will ever have.</p>
<p>My project supports any 13,56 MHz cards that comply with the smartcard standards 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_14443" target="_blank">ISO 14443</a> 
  A and B, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_field_communication" target="_blank">ISO 
  18092</a>.
  More details in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIFARE" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>.<br>
</p>
<p>You can compile the source code for two possible operation modes:</p>
<ol>
  <li>For <b>Mifare Classic </b>cards: In this mode only the ID of the card is 
    used to recognize a user and open the door. (not recommended)</li>
  <li>For <b>Mifare Desfire</b> cards: In this mode a cryprographic key of 128 
    bit or 168 bit protects the access to your door.</li>
</ol>
<p>But even in Mifare Classic mode a <b>brute force attack is impossible</b> because 
  the attacker does not know your card ID, which means that he would have to try 
  2^32 or even 2^56 possible card ID's. This is not possible because the code 
  running in the Teensy makes a delay of 1 second after an invalid trial to open 
  the door. The attacker would not live long enough to test all possibilities 
  because this would take 140 years.</p>
<h3>Mifare Classic Cards</h3>
<p>It would be possible to store a secret value on the Mifare Classic cards and 
  protect it with a key. But this does not make sense because the encryption of 
  Mifare Classic has been broken. When Philips designed the Classic cards they 
  made the error to implement a <b>weak cryptographic algorithm</b> (Crypto-1) 
  and trust in &quot;security-through-obscurity&quot;. The reason that these cards 
  are so wide spread (over 4 billions sold) is that the algorithm has been kept 
  secret for 14 years. But in 2008 a research team analyzed the chip under a microscope 
  and the algorithm implemented in hardware could be deduced. They found that 
  the key is a 48 bit key with several design flaws. You find more details in 
  <i><b>Reverse Engineering Mifare Classic cards.pdf</b></i> in the 
  ZIP file. The result is that today Mifare Classic cards <b><font color="#FF0000">can 
  be cloned in a few seconds</font></b> including all the data stored in the EEPROM 
  even if the data is protected with a key.</p>
<p>Normally the unique ID of a RFID card is assigned in the factory and cannot 
  be modified afterwards. But on eBay you can buy <b>chinese clones</b> which 
  allow to write any ID to the card. (Search for &quot;UID changeable card&quot;)</p>
<p>So it would theoretically be possible that a malicious person reads your Mifare 
  Classic card through your pocket and clones it to get access to your house. 
  This could be done with an Android NFC application that communicates with RFID 
  cards. There are also devices like the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gP9f_TiKHIY" target="_blank">Tastic 
  RFID Thief</a> which can read RFID cards from a distance of half a meter. So 
  if you decide to use Mifare Classic cards you should buy a <b>Stainless Steel 
  Wallet</b> which has a metal shield that blocks any external RF frequency getting 
  to your card, so cloning your card becomes impossible:</p>
<p><img src="Images/StainlessSteelWallet.png" width="288" height="172" alt="Stainless Steel Wallet"></p>
<h3>Old Mifare Desfire Cards</h3>
<p>In 2002 Philips introduced the Desfire cards which do not rely on a proprietary 
  algorithm anymore. Desfire uses (as the name says) DES encryption. However for 
  the <b>first generation</b> of Desfire cards an attack has been published that 
  allows to obtain encrypted data from the EEPROM by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side-channel_attack" target="_blank">Side 
  Channel Attack</a>. With a complex hardware the power consumption of the card 
  is measured during the encryption process. But this attack is far more difficult 
  than the Mifare Classic attack and takes about 7 hours.</p>
<p>You find a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1o2ST03O8I" target="_blank">video 
  on Youtube</a> where Timo Kaspar from Ruhr University in Bochum, Germany explains 
  (in english) how they hacked the old Desfire cards. At 18:20 minutes he starts 
  speaking about the Desfire attack and how they <b><font color="#FF0000">extracted 
  all the encryption keys from the card</font></b>, but the rest of the video 
  is also very interesting.</p>
<p>You should not use the old Desfire cards anymore. My project does not support 
  them because they require legacy authentication which is not implemented.</p>
<h3>Mifare Desfire EV1 Cards</h3>
<p>In 2009 the next generation came on the market: the <b>Mifare Desfire <font color="#FF0000">EV1</font></b> 
  cards which have been improved once again and until today no attack is known. 
  So if you use Desfire EV1 cards you do not need a Stainless Steel Wallet.<br>
</p>
<p>Buying Desfire EV1 cards is more difficult. There are not so many offers and 
  the cheaper ones require that you buy quantities of 50, 100 or even 500 cards. 
  I found these two companies which sell also smaller amounts: <a href="https://store.ryscc.com/search?q=desfire%2Bev1" target="_blank">RyscCorp</a> 
  and <a href="http://www.smartcardfocus.com" target="_blank">Smartcard Focus</a>. 
  You can also order from <a href="http://smartcardamerica.com/?portfolio=mifare-desfire-ev1-4k-card" target="_blank">Smartcard 
  America</a> who sell via eBay but their shipping is very expensive to other 
  countries.<br>
  <br>
  Be carefull with counterfeit offers from <b>China</b> on eBay: There is no guarantee 
  that chinese clones fulfill the same security criteria as original NXP cards.</p>
  
<a name="EV2"></a>
<h3>Mifare Desfire EV2 Cards</h3>  
<p>EV2 cards are improved EV1 cards. They have extended functionality and a reduced power consumption.
I did not test EV2 cards on my own. But users have 
<a href="https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1096861/DIY-electronic-RFID-Door-Lock-with-Battery-Backup?msg=5764612#xx5764612xx" target="_blank">reported</a>
that they use EV2 cards from 
<a href="https://www.karteo.de/NXP-MIFAREZ-DESFireZ-EV2-2K-CARDS" target="_blank">Karteo</a>
or
<a href="https://www.zutrittsshop.de/de/rfid-transponder-50/karten-und-tags-51/mifare-desfire-ev1-2kb-iso-card-13-56mhz-330.html" target="_blank">ZutrittsShop</a>
and that they can even read them up to 8 cm distance with the reader from 
<a href="https://www.elechouse.com/elechouse/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=90_93&products_id=2276" target="_blank">Elchouse</a>
or
<a href="https://paradisetronic.com/de/sensoren/nfc-kit-pn532-rfid-tag-mifare-karte" target="_blank">Paradisetronic</a>
which has a smaller antenna than the Adafruit reader. The version V4 from Elchouse has an improved PCB design for larger reading distance.
<br>NOTE: The card which is shipped with the Elchouse Reader is not a Desfire card.

<h3>Keyfobs</h3>  
<p>I ordered MIFARE Desfire EV3 keyfobs from Yarongtech on Amazon because they were relatively cheap (10 key tags for $30).
But they are useless. Already at a distance of more than 2 centimeters they cannot be read anymore.
The only key fobs that work well are Desfile Classic, but these are not secure.

<p>While Classic cards are completely static, the Desfire cards store data in 
  &quot;<b>files</b>&quot; of dynamic size that are contained in &quot;<b>applications</b>&quot;. 
  What is an application? An application is nothing more than a container for 
  files.<br>
  <br>
  Imagine a RFID card issued to the students of a university.<br>
  With the same card the student can eat in the canteen and he can park his car.<br>
  In this example there would be two independent applications on the card: One 
  canteen application and one parking application.<br>
  The student can charge money for lunch and for parking which is stored in a 
  file in the corresponding application.<br>
  Each application has one or multiple encryption keys (the <b>application keys</b>) 
  which allow to change the value stored in the respective application.<br>
  Each key may have only read permission, only write permission or both.<br>
  <br>
  Additionally the card has another important key: The <b>PICC master key</b>, 
  which is the &quot;god key&quot;.<br>
  The PICC master key allows to create and delete applications, assign keys to 
  each application or even format the entire card. But interestingly the PICC 
  master key can NOT access the data stored in the applications.<br>
  <br>
  Neither the canteen nor the parking deck know the PICC master key.<br>
  They have only access to their corresponding application but not outside of 
  it.<br>
</p>
<h1>The RFID reader</h1>
<p>The <b>PN532 breakout board</b> from <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/364" target="_blank">Adafruit</a> 
  (USD $40) has a chip from NXP (former Phillips).<br>
  When you order this board, it ships already with a white MIFARE card.<br>
  The board has a size of 12 cm x 5 cm and a thickness of 3 mm.<br>
  It works internally at 3,3V, but can be fed with 5V.</p>
<p>This board does not only read Mifare cards. It reads also your biometric passport, 
  FeliCa cards and does NFC (Near Field Communication). It also communicates with 
  Mastercard and Visa which have RFID integrated (PayPass, PayWave, ExpressPay), 
  Calypso and many more...<br>
  <br>
  The major advantage of this board over other hardware is that the antenna (printed 
  on the board) is very big (size of a RFID card). This allows larger read distances 
  than other hardware with smaller antennas.<br>
  Adafruit says that the antenna detects a card from a distance of up to <b>10 
  cm</b>.<br>
  This is true for the white Mifare Classic card that ships with the board.<br>
  But I have another card (from public transportation) that requires 7,5 cm to 
  be detected.<br>
  And I have a token that requires 5,5 cm to be detected. (The antenna in a token 
  is smaller than the antenna of a card) </p>
<p>For <b>Desfire</b> EV1 cards the maximum distance despends on the encryption, 
  because encryption increases the power consumption of the card:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If compiled in Classic mode (no encryption used) the distance can be up 
    to 6,3 cm.</li>
  <li>If compiled in Desfire mode with DES encryption the distance can be up to 
    5,3 cm.</li>
  <li>If compiled in Desfire mode with AES encryption the distance can be up to 
    4,0 cm.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>UPDATE:</b> Please read about <a href="#EV2">EV2 cards</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally I measured that the card consumes more power the more <b>memory</b> 
  it has. <br>
  A 4 kB card can be read from a larger distance than an 8 kB card. The difference 
  is approx 5 mm.<br>
  As my project occupies only a few bytes of the card's EEPROM you should buy 
  the smallest cards that you can find.<br>
</p>
<p>You mount the breakout board on the inside of your door.<br>
  You can mount a plastic or wooden box on top of it to protect it from mechanical 
  damage.<br>
  Into that box you also mount a two-color LED (red / green) that always shows 
  if the system is working properly.<br>
  <br>
  A long flat cable connects it with the main board.<br>
  Here you see a foto of the breakout board with the flat cable and the two-color 
  LED connected:</p>
<p><img src="Images/PN532.jpg" width="980" height="380" class="Img" style="max-width:1000px;" alt="PN532 board"></p>
<p>First you must <b>solder two jumpers</b> on the board that define the communication 
  mode.<br>
  I²C is too weak over a longer cable because I²C is an open collector bus with 
  pull up resistors.<br>
  I use <b>SPI</b> communication with a low speed of 10 kHz.<br>
  So you must set the jumpers: <b>SEL0 = OFF </b>and<b> SEL1 = ON</b>.<br>
  Read Wikipedia about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface_Bus" target="_blank">SPI</a> 
  and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C" target="_blank">I²C</a>.</p>
<p>Intentionally I do not use any plugs here because a soldered connection is 
  much more secure on a door, that may be slammed.</p>

<br><br><b><font color="#FF0000"><u>ATTENTION</u>:</font></b><br>
If you think that you can safe money by buying a much cheaper PN532 board from 
China like the one at the right you are wrong. These boards are offered in many 
places but do NOT work with Desfire cards. 
<p>The antenna of these boards is too tiny (4cm x 4cm) to send enough HF 
energy to the card. 
The result will be that you see <b><font color="#FF0000">TIMEOUT errors</font></b> 
at the moment when authenticating. <br>
<br>
  If you use EV1 cards you must order the PN532 board from Adafruit otherwise you will waste your time and money. 
  <br>You may try the small Chinese boards only if you use EV2 cards, but I have no experience with them.
</p>
<p>Please read about <a href="#EV2">EV2 cards</a>.</p>

<h3>Using I<sup>2</sup>C Bus</h3>

<p>The PN532 can also be controlled over the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C" target="_blank">I<sup>2</sup>C Bus</a> instead of SPI.
<br>A user has reported that he gets <b><font color="#FF0000">TIMEOUT errors</font></b> at the moment when authenticating with I<sup>2</sup>C. 
<br>He says the reason is that the Arduino library defines a buffer of only 32 bytes which is too small.
<br>I cannot prove if this is correct, but I publish his information here.
<br>Search the files <b>Wire.h</b> and <b>Twi.h</b> in your Arduino installation folder. There may be multiple.
<pre>In <b>Wire.h</b> change
#define BUFFER_LENGTH 32
into
#define BUFFER_LENGTH 64

In <b>Twi.h</b> change
#define TWI_BUFFER_LENGTH 32
into
#define TWI_BUFFER_LENGTH 64
</pre>

<h3>The cable connection between the boards</h3>
<p>Between the breakout board (mounted on the inside of the door) and the main 
  board (that you put in a safe place near the door) there is a longer cable required. 
  I use a <b>flat cable</b> of 10 wires.<br>
  If you don't want to use a flat cable you can also use a <b>network cable</b>. 
  But network cables have only 8 wires. In this case you can mount the LED at 
  another place (not on the door) and you will need only 8 wires.</p>
<p>SPI buses run normally with speeds of several Megahertz. This cannot be transmitted 
  over longer cables. So I use SPI at a speed of <b>10kHz</b>. Even over a cable 
  of 3 meters the signals look <b>absolutely clean</b> on the oscilloscope. I 
  suppose that even 10 meters would work without any problem.</p>
<p>When using Defire cards you could even attach an SPI spy to the cable but you 
  will never see a cryptographic key transmitted over the cable. During authentitacion 
  only encrypted random values are transferred and during a key change the new 
  key is sent encrypted with the secret session key that never leaves the Teensy.</p>

<h1>The Teensy Processor</h1>
<p>The heart of the main board is the microprocessor. I use a Teensy 3.2 or 4.0 from 
  <a href="https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy32.html" target="_blank">PJRC.com</a>. 
  <br>
  Teensy has several advantages compared with other Arduino-like boards: <br>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>It is very fast (32 bit ARM processor running at 96MHz)</li>
  <li>It is very tiny (3,5 cm x 1,5 cm)</li>
  <li>It has more RAM (64 kB) and flash program storage (260 kB) than other boards 
    and it has an EEPROM. <br>
    The newer Arduino boards (Due, Zero, 101) have no EEPROM at all, which makes 
    them useless.</li>
  <li>It is cheap (USD $20)</li>
  <li>The power consumption is low.</li>
  <li>It works internally at 3,3V, but can be fed with 5V.</li>
  <li>The Teensy library (TeensyDuino) has more and better functionality than 
    the offical Arduino libraries.</li>
</ol>
<p>First you must destroy a tiny jumper on the bottom side of the Teensy with 
  a cardboard cutter.<br>
  Otherwise the 5V coming from the USB cable would be connected directly with 
  the 5V power of the main board.<br>
  This would result in a current flowing if the main board is turned on while 
  the computer is turned off or vice versa.</p>
<p><img src="Images/Teensy.png" width="512" height="219" alt="Teensy 3.2"></p>
<p><b><font color="#FF0000"><u>ATTENTION</u>:</font></b><br>
If you think that you can safe money by buying a much cheaper Arduino board 
  you are wrong. These boards do not have enough memory. 
</p>
<p><img src="Images/ArduinoUno.png" width="265" height="190">
</p>
  When you compile the 
  sketch for Teensy you get this output from the compiler:<p></p>
<p><img src="Images/Compile.png"></p>
<p>This means that the sketch requires 11% of 64kByte = 7,6kB of RAM alone for 
  the global variables. Additionally more RAM is needed for the stack which stores 
  the local variables. This additional amount of RAM is dynamic and cannot be 
  calculated previously. The <b>Arduino Uno </b>has a ridiculous RAM of 2kB. The 
  sketch does not even run on the <b>Arduino Mega </b>which has 8kB RAM. You must 
  buy a Teensy 3.2 or 4.0 with 64kB RAM or you will waste your money and your time. When 
  you run the code on a board with insufficient RAM, the consequence may be errors, 
  crippled messages in the terminal or even <b>crashes.</b> You notice a crash 
  when the board does not respond anymore. The LED stops blinking.</p>
  
  
<h1>The Battery</h1>
<p>To assure that the door opens even during a power failure I use a 12V lead-acid 
  <b>stationary battery</b> (deep cycle battery). The battery delivers the high 
  current (1..2 Ampere) required to open the door.</p>
<p>If there is a <b>power failure</b>, the battery can keep the system working 
  for more than one week.</p>
<p>The electronics holds the battery voltage permanently at <b>13,6V</b>. At this 
  voltage (the so called &quot;float charge&quot;) the battery has the longest 
  life. If the battery would be charged and discharged in longer intervals the 
  life would be shortened.<br>
  A too high voltage (&gt; 14,4V) results in grid corrosion of the positive electrode.<br>
  A too low voltage results in sulfation on the negative plate. </p>
<p>At 13,6V the battery has a very high impedance. When you unplug the power supply 
  you will see that the voltage falls quickly (within 2 minutes) from 13,6V to 
  12,8V and then very very slowly to 12,0V (within several days). This is normal.</p>
<p><img src="Images/BatteryChargeCurve.png" width="553" height="286" class="Img" alt="Lead Acid Battery charge curve"></p>
<p>This diagram shows the charge state of a lead-acid battery which can be directly 
  deduced from the voltage. <br>
  You see that at 12,8V the battery is 100% full.</p>
<p>There are different types of lead acid batteries:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b><a href="http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/lead_based_batteries">Starter
    batteries</a></b>  with thin plates as used in a scooter.</li>
  <li><b><a href="http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/lead_based_batteries">Deep 
    cycle batteries</a></b> with thick plates as used in wheel chairs, UPS, alarm 
    systems or to store energy from a solar panel.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are different technologies of lead acid batteries:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Flooded batteries</b> (destilled water must be filled in from time to 
    time)</li>
  <li><b><a href="http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/bu_201b_gel_lead_acid_battery">Gel
    batteries</a></b>  (maintenance free)</li>
  <li><b><a href="http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/absorbent_glass_mat_agm">Absorbent 
    Glass Mat(AGM) batteries</a></b> (maintenance free)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to learn more about batteries have a look at <a href="http://batteryuniversity.com" target="_blank">batteryuniversity.com</a>.</p>
<p>I use a stationary, deep cycle AGM battery with 15Ah (USD $30). 12Ah is also 
  sufficient. The size is 94 x 151 x 98 mm. This battery is <b>MF</b> (Maintenance 
  Free) which means that it will never be necessary to fill destilled water into 
  it as in the good old days. When you buy it, it comes already charged and sealed.</p>
<p>As the content of the battery is not liquid, it is possible to mount the battery 
  in <b>any position</b>. You can lay the battery on the back side and mount the 
  main board on top of it to save space.</p>
<p>Lead-Acid batteries don't like high temperatures and you should store them 
  only in charged state, otherwise their life is shortened.</p>
<p>Be very carefull with the battery! If you produce a shortcut, the current that 
  flows will be more than 100 Ampere! Anything between the poles will convert 
  into a cloud of smoke!</p>
<p><b>IMPORTANT:</b> Lead is toxic. An old battery must be<b> recycled</b>.</p>


<h1>The Main Board</h1>
<p><img src="Images/Mainboard.jpg" width="700" height="838" style="max-width:1000px;" alt="RFID Door Access System"><br>
  <br>
</p>
<p><img src="Images/Circuit.png" class="Img" width="754" height="836" style="max-width:1000px;" alt="RFID Door access system"></p>


<p>When the<b> relay</b> switches the door opens. The relay is activated for 100 
  ms (the interval can be configured in the source code). <br>
  The second relay is optional and is missing in the diagram to keep it simple. 
  But you find it in the board layout (see below).<br>
  <br>
  The <b>transformer</b> has just the power to charge the battery. The battery 
  should not be charged with a current higher than 10% of it's capacity, otherwise 
  the lifetime would be shortened. For a 12Ah battery this results in a maximum 
  charging current of 1,2A which is more than the maximum current of the 7815, 
  so it will never be reached. A 16V transformer delivers a peak voltage of 16V 
  * &radic;2 = 22,5V. When the battery is very empty this voltage may collapse.</p>
<p>The <b>7815</b> is a voltage regulator with the following characteristics:</p>

  </tr>
</table>
<p>When the battery is full the <b>7815</b> only delivers the current for the 
  Teensy and the PN532 (average 46 mA). Only after a long power failure more current 
  will flow into the battery. So normally the 7815 will not become hot and a <b>cooler</b> 
  is not necessary. If you have long power failures in your country a cooler is 
  recommended. In the photo above you see a cooler (aluminium plate) which is 
  used for both, the 7805 and the 7815.</p>
<p>When the processor detects that something is wrong with the voltage (&lt; 13,0V 
  or &gt; 14,0V) the red LED will flash to show that there is a problem. The cause 
  may be a power failure or a defect.</p>
<p>When the processor detects that the battery voltage drops more than 1 Volt 
  when the door is opened this means that the <b>battery is old</b> and must be 
  replaced soon. A new battery can deliver several Amperes without voltage drop. 
  But the older the battery gets the higher becomes its impedance. When the battery 
  must be replaced the red and green LED flash alternatingly.</p>
<p>The resistor marked with a <b>yellow exclamation mark</b> acts like a fuse. 
  In case of a shortcut (e.g. in the 7805) it will die and avoid that more than 
  100A flow through the circuit. This resistor should be 1/4W.</p>

<h3>The Board Layout</h3>
<p>In the ZIP file you find my design for a single layer breadboard to be soldered 
  manually. This board is very easy to solder even for electronic beginners. It 
  took me only half a day to connect everything.<br>
</p>

<p>On the board you see two relay. The<b> upper relay</b> is optional. It allows 
  to open two doors independently. If you don't need that you can omit the green 
  parts.<br>
</p>
<h3>How to calculate Rx</h3>
<p>The resistor Rx limits the current through the door opener solenoid which you 
  see in the picture below.<br>
  Here you see the lock opened (bottom plate removed).<br>
  I mount this lock on top of the inside of the door. I removed the former key 
  lock so there is nothing that can be manipulated from the outside.</p>
<p><img src="Images/Doorlock.jpg" width="610" height="431" alt="Scanavini doorlock"></p>
<p>First you connect the solenoid to a regulatable DC power supply. Rise the voltage 
  from zero slowly up until the lock opens.<br>
  In my case this happens at 2,8V. <br>
  But this is too insecure. A higher voltage must be applied to be sure that it 
  always opens.<br>
  I chose to apply 3,5V.<br>
  Then I measure the current that flows at 3,5V which is 1,3A.<br>
  <br>
  As I have to open two doors simultaneously I connect both solenoids in series.<br>
  So I need 7V at a current of 1,3A for both.<br>
  <br>
  At Rx there will be a voltage of 12V - 7V = 5V which results in a resistor of:<br>
</p>
<pre>R = U/I = 5V/1,3A = 3,8 Ohm</pre>
Now calculate the power of the resistor:<br>
  
<pre>P = U*I = 5V*1,3A = 6,5W</pre>
<p>If your local electronic shop does not have this value you can switch multiple 
  resistors in parallel.<br>
  For example 4 * 15&Omega; of which each should have a power of 2 Watt. <br>
  This will result in a total resistor of 3,75&Omega; with 8 Watt.</p>
<p>To calculate two resistors in parallel you can use the formula: 
<pre>R total = (R1 * R2) / (R1 + R2)</pre>


<h1>The meaning of the LED</h1>

<h1>Optimizing Power Consumption</h1>
<p>Everything has been done to reduce the power consumption:<br>
</p>
<p>The highest power consumption comes from the PN532 board: As chipcards and 
  tokens have no battery, they must be powered externally.<br>
  The PN532 has to generate a <b>RF field of 13 MHz</b> that feeds power to the 
  chipcard through the antenna. When generating that field, the PN532 consumes 
  110mA. There is a command that allows to turn the RF field off. But without 
  RF field there is no card detection possible. So what my code does is to turn 
  on the RF field for 100ms to check if there is a card and then turn off the 
  field for 1 second. When the RF field is off the PN532 consumes only 18mA. The 
  result is an average consumption of 26mA.</p>
<p>The power consumption of the<b> Teensy</b> is 40mA at a CPU clock of 96MHz. 
  As such a high speed is not needed, the clock is set to 24MHz which reduces 
  the power consumption to 20mA.</p>
<p>Finally the total current is on average 46mA.</p>
<p>The interval that the <b> relay</b> is powered is optimized. A high current 
  is flowing through the solenoid. You have to test which interval works for your 
  solenoid. You can modify that in source code. In my case the solenoid already 
  works with an interval of 20 ms. But to make it bulletproof I programed 100 
  ms.</p>
  
  
<h1>Life Expectations</h1>
<p>Today we are used that electronic devices have a short life, especially those 
  that come from <b>China</b>.<br>
  But it has not been like this ever since.</p>
<p>Once upon a time there was the good old &quot;<b>Made in Germany</b>&quot; 
  which always meant high quality and long life. I have an amplifier from <b>Grundig</b> 
  that I bought in the beginning of the 1990's. It is still working today. I repaired 
  it only once in neary 30 years! </p>
<p>But already in the 1980's the first japanese products came on the market which 
  were just cheaper but worse in quality. In those years the clients have chosen 
  that they prefer to pay less for a cheaper japanese product than for a high 
  quality german brand. In these years there was a high quality decrease world 
  wide. Today China is continuing these tendencies.</p>
<p>There are even people who suspect that companies build their devices intentionally 
  to have a short life (&quot;<b>Planned Obsolescence</b>&quot;). But this could 
  not be confirmed till this day. The truth is that the industry is in a hard 
  price war. Companies HAVE to design their products cheap because otherwise the 
  client will not buy them. The client is the culprit because he is not willing 
  to pay more for higher quality. Do you remember the war between the cheap japanese 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VHS" target="_blank">VHS</a> and the 
  much better german <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_2000" target="_blank">Video 
  2000</a>? The worse system won the war because the client didn't want to pay 
  the price that quality costs!</p>
<p>How do companies lower the price? In the first place by using the cheapest 
  electronic parts possible. The result is that often parts are <b>underdesigned</b>. 
  If for example a transistor is designed for a maximum <b>voltage</b> of 1500 
  Volt and it is running permanently with a voltage of 1200 Volt it is obvious 
  that this transistor will have a short life (approx 5 years), because it is 
  permanently running at it's limits. On the other hand a transistor designed 
  for 100 Volt, but running at 5 Volt will have a significantly longer life (&gt; 
  30 years). The same applies for<b> currents</b>.</p>
<p>Also mostly the <b>coolers</b> for power transistors or ICs are designed too 
  small (or even missing) to save money and space. </p>
<p>Another common cause for failures are <b>plugs</b> and switches. With 
  the years their contacts oxidate and the connection may get lost completely. 
  Good plugs have golden contacts, but as gold is expensive, companies mostly 
  don't use them.</p>
<p>But also the other extreme exists. Think about<b> high quality</b> electronics 
  that must not fail: <br>
  For example in medicine, in a satellite or in a military jet. <br>
  Here the engineers surely will NOT chose the cheapest parts (that run at their 
  limits) to make the electronic as <b>fail safe</b> as possible. They may even 
  add electronic parts that take over control when other parts fail. For example 
  5 condensators switched parallel where one would be enough. </p>
<p>I have repaired electronic devices for many years and have a lot of experience 
  which are the electronic parts that fail first. These are generally semiconductors 
  that work with high voltages, high currents and that become hot. Also electrolyte 
  condensators that operate with high currents are failing frequently (which is 
  the most common reason for the death of switched-mode power supplies).</p>
<p>I have designed this door opener for a <b>long life</b>. There are no parts 
  that become hot in normal operation. The high current for the door opener solenoid 
  is switched by a relay rather than a transistor, because relays are much more 
  robust.</p>
<p>I recommend to use a <b>rectifier</b> that tolerates 3 Ampere although only 
  a few mA are flowing if the battery is full.</p>
<p><b>Do NOT replace the transformer and rectifier with a DC power supply</b> 
  (like those for laptops). The switched power supplies from China have cheap 
  electronic parts inside which are exposed to 220V and will die soon. On the 
  other hand a regular transformer has an eternal life. I never had to replace 
  a dead power transformer in decades of repairing all kind of electronic stuff. 
  The ONLY advantage of switched power supplies is that they are smaller and have 
  less weight, but apart from that they are the worst solution because they have 
  a short life.</p>
<p>You should avoid plugs wherever possible. In my photo you see that the Teensy 
  is <b>soldered directly</b> on the board just to avoid contact problems in the 
  future. The plug for the flat cable should have gold contacts. I also soldered 
  the cables directly to the battery to avoid plugs. To make it easier to disconnect 
  the battery I added 2 screw joints. Other battery models already come with screw 
  clamps.</p>
<p>The only part that must be replaced after some years is the <b>battery</b>. 
  When you see the LED flashing alternatingly in green and red, the battery is 
  dying.</p>
<p> Finally I suppose that the life expectation of the electronics should be <b>20 
  - 30 years</b> or even more.</p>


<h1>Loading the firmware into the Teensy</h1>
<ol>
  <li><b>Option A</b>:<br>
    You can either install the Arduino compiler from <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software" target="_blank">arduino.cc</a> 
    and the Teensyduino library from <a href="https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_download.html" target="_blank">PJRC.com</a> 
    and compile the sketch that you find in the ZIP file above. You must configure 
    the compiler settings like this:<br>
    <br>
    <img src="Images/Compiler.png" class="Img" width="377" height="274"> <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Option B</b>:<br>
    Or you don't install anything and load the <b>precompiled firmware</b> directly 
    to a Teensy board. You find the HEX file and the TeensyLoader.exe 
    in the ZIP file.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Communicating with the Teensy</h3>
<p>You need a <b>Micro USB cable</b> to connect your computer with the Teensy.<br>
  First you have to install the Teensy Serial <b>driver</b> that makes the Teensy 
  appear as a virtual COM port on your PC.<br>
  You find the driver in the ZIP file.</p>
<p>You can communicate to the Teensy with a terminal program.<br>
  You can use the freeware <a href="https://en.osdn.jp/projects/ttssh2/releases/" target="_blank"><b>TeraTerm</b></a> 
  or the Serial Monitor that is built into the Arduino Compiler.</p>
<p>You don't have to care about the <b>baudrate</b>, because theTeensy ignores 
  it (unlike older Arduino boards). The data is always transmitted with USB speed.</p>
<p>If you use the <b>Serial Monitor</b> you must select the COM port (Menu &quot;Tools&quot;, 
  see image above) and configure it to send LineFeeds:</p>
<p><img src="Images/SerialMonitor.png" width="420" height="68"></p>
<p>If you use <b>TeraTerm</b> you only have to select the COM port:</p>
<p><img src="Images/TeraTerm.png" width="460" height="288" alt="TeraTerm"></p>
<p><b><u>IMPORTANT</u></b>: If the Teensy does not have power (if you disconnect 
  the battery) or if you press the &quot;Program&quot; button on the Teensy while 
  the COM port is open in the terminal program you will first have to close the 
  COM port, disconnect the USB cable, reconnect it and then open the COM port 
  anew!<br>
  To avoid this you should first close the COM port (Menu &quot;Disconnect&quot; 
  in TeraTerm) before you remove power supply from the Teensy or press the &quot;Program&quot; 
  button.<br>
  The reason is that Windows does not remove the COM port while any program has 
  the port still open (although the Teensy has already been disconnected).</p>
  
  
<h1>Managing Users</h1>
<p>After opening the COM port in the terminal program you will first see nothing.<br>
  If <b>password</b> protection is enabled you must enter the password now and 
  hit Enter, otherwise you only hit <b>Enter</b>.</p>
<p>In both cases the main menu will appear:</p>
<p><img src="Images/MainMenu.png" width="649" height="305" style="max-width:1000px;"></p>
<p>The menu shows the available commands and the actual status.<br>
  You can store more than 64 users in the EEPROM if you reduce the amount of characters 
  for the user name.<br>
  <br>
  <font color="#0000FF"><b>CLEAR<br>
  </b></font>The first thing that you <b>always</b> have to do on a new Teensy 
  board is to clear the EEPROM: <br>
  Type &quot;clear&quot; and hit Enter.</p>
<p><img src="Images/CmdClear.png" width="409" height="81"></p>
<p><b><font color="#0000FF">ADD</font></b><br>
  To add access permission for a new user, type &quot;add&quot; followed by the 
  user name and Enter.<br>
</p>
<p><img src="Images/CmdAdd.png" width="462" height="163"></p>
<p>As you see, these cards use a 7 byte UID (Desfire).<br>
  Apart from storing the card ID and user name in Teensy's EEPROM several steps 
  are executed on a Desfire card. See below.</p>
<p>It is possible to store multiple cards for the same user name.<br>
  If you later delete that user with the DEL command all his cards will be deleted 
  at once.<br>
  If you prefer to be able to delete the cards individually you can give each 
  card a unique name like &quot;John Hilton 1&quot;, &quot;John Hilton 2&quot;, 
  etc... </p>
<p> <b><font color="#0000FF">DOOR1, DOOR2, DOOR12</font></b><br>
  By default a new user can open only door 1. You can give the user permission 
  to open one of the doors or both.</p>
<p><img src="Images/CmdDoor.png" width="465" height="31"></p>
<p><b><font color="#0000FF">LIST</font></b><br>
  To show all users that are authorized, use the LIST command. Users are sorted 
  alphabetically. </p>
<p><img src="Images/CmdList.png" width="464" height="52"></p>
<p><b><font color="#0000FF">DEL</font></b><br>
  This command deletes a user and his card from the EEPROM so he will not be able 
  to open the door anymore.<br>
  The DEL command does not require a card to be present, so the changes made on 
  the card will not be reverted.<br>
  Use this command if a user has lost his card. </p>
<p><img src="Images/CmdDel.png" width="362" height="31"></p>
<p><b><font color="#0000FF">RESTORE</font></b><br>
  The RESTORE command also deletes a card and it's user from the EEPROM, but it 
  additionally reverts all changes on the card.<br>
  RESTORE resets the PICC master key to the factory default key and deletes the 
  application that has been created on a Desfire default card.</p>
<p><img src="Images/CmdRestore.png" width="389" height="76"></p>
<p><b><font color="#0000FF">RESET</font></b><br>
  The RESET command pulls the RSTPDN line of the PN532 to LOW for 400ms which 
  resets the board.<br>
  Afterwards the chip initialization runs anew and the capabilities of the chip 
  are read.</p>
<p><img src="Images/CmdReset.png" width="453" height="61"></p>
<p>Apart from this command the PN532 is automatically reset when a communication 
  error has been detected.</p>
<p><b><font color="#0000FF">MAKERANDOM</font></b><br>
  This command configures a Desfire card to always send a different random ID 
  and hide it's real UID.<br>
  See below for more details about the different operation modes.</p>
<p><img src="Images/CmdRandom.png" width="591" height="104"><br>
  <br>
  <font color="#0000FF"><b>TEST</b></font><br>
  Executes a Selftest that tests all Desfire commands. (see below)<br>
</p>


<h1>The PN532 Communication Protocol</h1>
<p>The PN532 uses a very complicated communication protocol. You find the description 
  in the manual in the ZIP file.</p>
<p><img src="Images/SpiCommunication.png" width="588" height="327" alt="PN532 communication"></p>
<ol>
  <li>First the Host sends one single byte (<b>DW</b> = Data Write) which tells 
    the PN532 that now data will be sent.</li>
  <li>Then the host sends a <b>command frame</b> which contains an instruction 
    to be executed.</li>
  <li>Then the host sends one single byte (<b>SR</b> = Status Read) that asks 
    for the status of the PN532.</li>
  <li>If the PN532 is not yet ready it responds with a 0x00 byte. This means that 
    the host has to wait. When the PN532 is ready it responds with a 0x01 byte.</li>
  <li>Then the host sends one single byte (<b>DR</b> = Data Read) which tells the 
    PN532 that it expects a data packet.</li>
  <li>Then the PN532 sends an <b>ACK</b> frame (Acknowledge) which is a fixed 
    sequence of bytes (00, 00, FF, 00, FF, 00). This confirms that the command 
    has been received correctly.</li>
  <li>Then the host sends one single byte (<b>SR </b>= Status Read) that asks 
    for the status of the PN532. </li>
  <li>When the PN532 is ready it responds with a 0x01 byte.</li>
  <li>Then the host sends one single byte (<b>DR</b> = Data Read) which tells the 
    PN532 that it expects a data packet.</li>
  <li>And finally the PN532 sends the <b>response frame</b>.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>The Data Frames</h3>
<p>The Command frame and the Response frame look like this:</p>
<p><img src="Images/DataPacket.png" width="628" height="282" alt="PN532 command"></p>
<p>The Preamble and Postamble are optional.<br>
  The receiver of the packet must first search for the start sequence {00, FF} 
  which marks the begin of the packet.<br>
  Then comes the length of the data followed by a length checksum.<br>
  The frame identifier (TFI) is 0xD4 if the frame is sent from the host to the 
  PN532 and 0xD5 for the opposite direction.<br>
  After the packet data comes a checksum.</p>
  
  
<h1>The Adafruit Library</h1>
<p>A library of 1000 lines of code is required to communicate with the PN532.<br>
  <br>
  From the Adafruit site you can download an Arduino code and samples that show 
  the communication with the PN532. But sadly this code can only be used for testing 
  but the code is sloppy and buggy and cannot be used in production.<br>
  I had to rewrite the Adafruit code completely. Here the list of my changes:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Removed all compiler warnings that appeared when compiling Adafruit code. 
  <li><b>Bugfix</b>: (Severe bug) Adafruit used <code>strncmp()</code> to compare 
    binary data (which contains zeroes). This is completey wrong -&gt; replaced 
    with <code>memcmp()</code></li>
  <li><b>Bugfix</b>: (Severe bug) Adafruit code does not check for valid response 
    packets. The checksum is completely ignored. Bytes received before the start 
    code are not skipped!</li>
  <li><b>Bugfix</b>: (Severe bug) Adafruit code used a timeout = 0 (wait forever). 
    This is completely wrong. If the chip does not respond, the code hangs forever! 
    My code is &quot;self healing&quot; which means that even after unplugging 
    the PN532 board and reconnecting it, the chip will be reset and afterwards 
    it works again.</li>
  <li><b>Bugfix</b>: Adafruit code does not allow to distinguish why <code>readPassiveTargetID()</code> 
    returns false. (Because there is no card or because of a communication problem?)</li>
  <li>Added support for Value blocks (in Mifare.cpp)</li>
  <li>Added memory Dump (in Mifare.cpp)<br>
  </li>
  <li> The IRQ line is not required anymore in I²C mode. Now the software handshake 
    is used instead.</li>
  <li>Software SPI slow speed added (to get 10kHz clock)</li>
  <li>Implemented the correct wake up procedure (sending PN532_WAKEUP) instead 
    of sending getFirmwareVersion.</li>
  <li>Debug output was buggy: The checksum bytes were displayed as 0xFFFFFFFC 
    instead of 0xFC. Removed useless &quot;0x&quot; before each byte.</li>
  <li>Detailed debug output was missing. </li>
  <li>Added display of valid data bytes inside the packet in debug output.</li>
  <li>Using <code>getFirmwareVersion()</code> was very clumsy -&gt; completely 
    rewritten</li>
  <li><code>writeGPIO()</code> rewritten -&gt; no warning about wrong usage anymore.</li>
  <li><code>AuthenticateDataBlock()</code>, <code>ReadDataBlock()</code> and <code>WriteDataBlock()</code> 
    rewritten.</li>
  <li><code>setPassiveActivationRetries()</code> did not have any error checking 
    at all.</li>
  <li>Ugly code in <code>writecommand()</code> completely rewritten</li>
  <li>Crappy code like this removed: <code>int offset = _usingSPI ? 5 : 6;</code></li>
  <li>The library completely avoids the <code>new</code> operator.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>My new PN532 library, that you find in the ZIP file, supports 3 communication 
  modes:</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Software SPI:</b><br>
    This one is used because it allows to throttle the SPI bus to run at 10kHz 
    for transmission over a long cable.<br>
    The advantage of Software SPI is that you can chose any Teensy pin for SCK, 
    MISO, MOSI and SSEL.</li>
  <li><b>Hardware SPI:</b><br>
    This also works but one disadvantage is that the Teensy uses the same pin 
    for hardware SCK as the built-in LED on the board. (Pin 13) So the LED cannot 
    be used in this mode. Additionally the Teensy library does not allow to set 
    a clock of 10kHz.</li>
  <li><b>I²C:</b><br>
    This also works but an open collector bus cannot be transmitted over a long 
    cable. I changed the I²C code so that the IRQ line is not needed anymore.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>Read Wikipedia about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface_Bus" target="_blank">SPI</a> 
  and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C" target="_blank">I²C</a>. 
</p>


<h1>The Desfire EV1 Library</h1>
<p>In addition to re-writing the PN532 code I created a new Desfire library (about 
  2700 lines of code). Currently there is no code available in internet to control 
  Desfire cards with Ardiuno/Teensy. <b><br>
  <br>
  <font color="#990000">This is the first library that has ever been written for 
  the Arduino family</font></b><font color="#990000">. <b>You have to change only 
  a few lines in Utils.h and you can compile the library on Visual Studio, Linux 
  or other platforms. </b><br>
  </font> </p>
<p>Using my library is very easy and the integrated <b>Selftest</b> gives a living 
  example how to call the functions.<br>
  The library completely avoids the <code>new</code> operator.<br>
  The code is professional C++ code, reusable, very well structured and commented.<br>
</p>
<p>The library will not work with old Desfire cards (deprecated) because legacy 
  authentication is not implemented. You really need EV1 cards.</p>
<p>If you search a datasheet for Desfire EV1 cards you will only find the &quot;short 
  version&quot; on the NXP website which is quite useless.</p>
<p>To get the complete documentation you have to make a <b><a href="https://www.mifare.net/support/forum/topic/documentation-request-nda-enough/" target="_blank">Non-Disclosure 
  Agreement</a> </b>(NDA) with NXP where you promise not to give this documentation 
  to anybody else. This NDA is made only with companies. It is incredible that 
  NXP did not learn from their own errors in the past. Did the Mifare Classic 
  desaster not show clearly that &quot;security-through-obscurity&quot; does not 
  work? Is Windows more secure than Linux because Microsoft maintains the source 
  code secret? And does NXP really believe that hiding information still works 
  in the age of file sharing, Wikileaks and Edward Snowden? Or is NXP so naive 
  to believe that a chinese company, that wants to produce a counterfeit card, 
  is not able to obtain that documentation? Whatever might be the idea behind 
  that NDA: Any sane person will agree that it is pure nonsense.<br>
  However, I never made that contract with NXP and so I do not have the full documentation.<br>
</p>
<p>But this documentation is not needed at all because I found some Desfire open 
  source projects that are hosted on Github: <a href="https://github.com/nceruchalu/easypay" target="_blank">easypay</a>, 
  <a href="https://github.com/leg0/libfreefare" target="_blank">libfreefare</a> 
  and <a href="http://liblogicalaccess.islog.com" target="_blank">liblogicalaccess</a>. 
  By studying their code, fixing their bugs, experimenting with the card and with 
  the help of Google I wrote my own Desfire library:</p>

</table>
<p>Writing this library was really a <b>challenge</b>, especially due to the lack 
  of documentation. It took weeks of my life to finish this project. The most 
  difficult parts are the authentication with a cryptographic key and the key 
  change. During <b>authentication</b> random values are encrypted and exchanged 
  between the card and the host to prove that both sides share the same master 
  key. From these random values a <b>session key</b> is generated. All encryption 
  goes through <b>Cipher Block Chaining</b>, where NXP distinguishes between Enciphering/Deciphering 
  and Send Mode/Receive Mode. The cryptographic initialization vector (<b>IV</b>) 
  is reset only once when authenticating, then for all further commands it must 
  be maintained up to date. If your IV vector comes out of sync with the one that 
  the card has calculated internally you will get an Integrity Error. All the 
  data sent to the card and all the data received from the card must go though 
  a <b>CMAC</b> calculation (something like a hash). Some functions calculate 
  a CMAC, others do not. When changing a key, two <b>CRC32</b> values have to 
  be calculated and the old key and the new key are XORed, padded and then encrypted 
  with the session key. Each type of key has it's own peculiarities: AES encrypts 
  blocks of 16 byte while DES uses 8 byte blocks and the length of the key itself 
  may be 8, 16 or 24 byte. As a consquence also the length of the random values 
  and the session key vary with the key type. All this stuff is HIGHLY complicated 
  and you have thousands of pitfalls. And the worst of all is that in internet 
  you find nearly no usefull information. I feel like a pioneer in Defire EV1 
  development. </p>
<p>I have chosen the smallest open source crypto libraries that I could find: 
  AES128 from Texas Instruments and 3DES from Eric Young. Although the entire 
  Desfire source code has about 2700 lines, the size of the compiled code is small:<br>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Compiled for Mifare Classic cards it consumes 18% of the flash memory</li>
  <li>Compiled for Mifare Desfire cards it consumes 27% of the flash memory</li>
</ol>
<p> So all the crypto stuff consumes only <b>9% of the flash memory</b>. Please 
  note that the compiler omits all functions from compilation that are not in 
  use.</p>


<h1>The Three Operation Modes</h1>
<p>Depending on the compiler switches and the card types you can have 3 different 
  operation modes:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Compiled with <code>#define USE_DESFIRE false</code> you get <b>Classic</b> 
    mode,</li>
  <li>Compiled with <code>#define USE_DESFIRE true</code> and default Desfire 
    cards you get <b>Desfire Default </b>mode,</li>
  <li>Compiled with <code>#define USE_DESFIRE true</code> and random ID Desfire 
    cards you get <b>Desfire Random</b> mode.</li>
</ol>
<p>It depends only on the card if the system is working in Desfire default mode 
  or in Desfire random mode. So these both types of cards can be used mixed at 
  the same time. </p>
<p>To convert a default Desfire card into a random Desfire card you have to execute 
  the command <b>MAKERANDOM</b>.<br>
  <font color="#FF0000"><b>ATTENTION:</b></font> If a card has once been converted 
  to use random ID, NXP does not allow to reverse this anymore. (Why??)</p>

<p>In source code you can additionally chose which master keys you want to use 
  for Desfire cards:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Compiled with <code>#define USE_AES true</code> you use 128 bit AES keys 
    (max. reader distance: 4,0 cm)</li>
  <li>Compiled with <code>#define USE_AES false</code> you use 168 bit 3K3DES 
    keys (max. reader distance: 5,3 cm)</li>
</ol>
<p>In source code you find the file <b>Secrets.h</b> which contains:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The PICC master key (AES or 3K3DES),</li>
  <li>A cryptographic key (3K3DES) to derive the application master key from card 
    ID, user name and random data (for Desfire default mode),</li>
  <li>A cryptographic key (3K3DES) to derive the secret store value from card 
    ID, user name and random data (for Desfire default mode).</li>
</ol>
<p>Before compiling the source code for the fist time you should change these 
  3 keys to anything else.</p>
<p><span class="Error">ATTENTION: </span>If you already have personalized cards and then change the 
  PICC master key in source code you cannot authenticate these cards anymore. 
  Therefore it is important that you <b>first</b> execute the <b>RESTORE</b> command 
  on all personalized cards and <b>afterwards</b> change the PICC master key in 
  code. The RESTORE command resets the PICC master key to the factory default 
  DES key full of zeroes.</p>
  
  
<h1>Debugging</h1>
  
<h3>Debug Level 1</h3>
<p>If anything goes wrong in the communication you can use the debugging that 
  I have implemented.</p>
<p>Via terminal enter the command &quot;<b>debug 1</b>&quot; to activate basic 
  debugging.<br>
  Here you see a part of the debug output at level 1 when a default Desfire card 
  is personalized:</p>
<p><img src="Images/CmdAddDesfire.png" width="896" height="600" style="max-width:1000px;"></p>
<p><b><font color="#0000FF">NOTE: You find debug output of the entire selftest 
  in the ZIP file.</font></b> </p>
<h3>Debug Level 2</h3>
<p>Enter &quot;<b>debug 2</b>&quot;<b> </b>and additionally the data packets will 
  be shown:</p>
<p><img src="Images/CmdDebug1.png" width="656" height="135" style="max-width:1000px;"></p>
<p>Now you see the commands sent to the PN532 and the responses received from 
  the PN532.<br>
  The data bytes are marked between '&lt;' and '&gt;' characters in each valid 
  packet.</p>
<p>The command <code>ReadPassiveTargetID</code> turns on the RF field and checks if 
  there is a card present. <br>
  If there is no card, only 3 data bytes are returned (D5 4B 00).<br>
  The command <code>SwitchOffRfField</code> turns the RF field off to save battery.</p>
<p>If a card has been detected the response looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="Images/ReadCard.png" width="669" height="146" style="max-width:1000px;"></p>
<p>You see that now more bytes are transmitted. They contain the unique ID of 
  the card and additional information about the card.<br>
  In this example the code has been compiled for Mifare <b>Classic</b> cards. 
  The ID is 4 bytes long.<br>
  When the card is authorized, the door opens and the green LED flashes for 1 
  second. <br>
  If the card is not authorized, the red LED flashes for 1 second and the door 
  does not open.</p>
<p>If the code is compiled for Mifare <b>Desfire</b> cards additional cryptographic 
  operations are executed before the door is opened.</p>
<h3>Debug Level 3</h3>
<p>Enter &quot;<b>debug 3</b>&quot; to activate detailed debugging:</p>
<p><img src="Images/CmdDebug2.png" width="678" height="346" style="max-width:1000px;"></p>
<p>Now you see each and every byte that is transmitted between the Teensy and 
  the PN532, including the ACK package and the status bytes.</p>
<h3>Errors</h3>
<p>Whenever the Teensy detects that the PN532 did not respond as expected, an 
  error is printed to the terminal.</p>
<p><img src="Images/Error.png" width="658" height="193" style="max-width:1000px;"></p>
<p>This example shows the case that the PN532 did not respond at all. The Teensy 
  pulls the RSTPDN line to LOW to reset the chip, sends the WakeUp packet (see 
  Manual) and tries again to communicate with the chip.</p>
<p>Additionally the red LED will flash very slowly so you see immediately that 
  there is a severe error.</p>
<p><br>
  If you use Desfire cards you will probably see a <b>Timeout Error</b> from time 
  to time. This happens only when the card is too far away from the antenna of 
  the PN532. This Timeout means that the PN532 did not receive an answer from 
  the card. In this case any further command sent to the card will return another 
  Timeout error. Any communication with the card is stalled. The only way out 
  is to call <code>SwitchOffRfField()</code> and connect again with <code>ReadPassiveTargetID()</code>. 
  The commands executed first (<code>GetKeyVersion()</code> and <code>SelectApplication()</code>) 
  work fine and when it comes to authenticate the communication breaks down. The 
  reason is that encryption increases the power consumption of the card. Strangely 
  AES uses more power than DES. When you use AES the card must be in a distance 
  of 4,0 cm from the PN532. When using DES the distance can be up to 5,3 cm.</p>
<p>Note that there are basically two types of timeouts: (First the Teensy waiting 
  for response from the PN532 and second the PN532 waiting for response from the 
  card) If you put the card directly on the antenna of the reader you should never 
  get a timeout error. Turn on Debugging to see what happens.</p>

<h1>Analyzing SPI / I²C bus / UART</h1>

<p>If you have any problems with the SPI or I²C bus or UART communication and you have an oscilloscope that can connect to a computer over USB,
<br>you can use my open source software <a href="https://netcult.ch/elmue/Oszi-Waveform-Analyzer" target="_blank">Oszi Waveform Analyzer</a>
which converts your oscilloscope into a logic analyzer. 
<br>After A/D conversion of the analog inputs the SPI decoder shows the bytes on the bus:
